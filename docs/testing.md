# Testing

## Go workspace
This repo uses a `go.work` workspace that aggregates the modules under `agents/` and `tools/`.
Running `go test ./...` from the repo root will fail because the root directory is not itself a module.

## Running tests
Use the repo test runner from the root:

```bash
./tools/test.sh
```

That script runs `go test` across the workspace modules listed in `go.work`.
